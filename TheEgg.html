                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You were on your way home when you
                died. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was a car accident. Nothing
                particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two
                children. It was a painless death. The <span class=SpellE>EMTs</span> tried
                their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you
                were better off, trust me. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And that’s when you met me. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“What… what happened?” You asked.
                “Where am I?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“You died,” I said,
                matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“There was a… a truck and it was
                skidding…”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Yup,” I said.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“I… I died?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it.
                Everyone dies,” I said.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You looked around. There was
                nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the
                afterlife?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“More or less,” I said. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Are you god?” You asked.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“My kids… my wife,” you said. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“What about them?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Will they be all right?” </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“That’s what I like to see,” I
                said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good
                stuff right there.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You looked at me with fascination.
                To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a
                woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher
                than the almighty. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be
                fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have
                time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be
                secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any
                consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Oh,” you said. “So what happens
                now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be
                reincarnated.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus
                were right,”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“All religions are right in their
                own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You followed along as we strode
                through the void. “Where are we going?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Nowhere in particular,” I said.
                “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“So what’s the point, then?” You
                asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my
                experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Not so!” I said. “You have within
                you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t
                remember them right now.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>I stopped walking and took you by
                the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you
                can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you
                are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or
                cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it
                back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“You’ve been in a human for the
                last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your
                immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start
                remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“How many times have I been
                reincarnated, then?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to
                lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese
                peasant girl in 540 AD.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Wait, what?” You stammered.
                “You’re sending me back in time?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Well, I guess technically. Time,
                as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come
                from.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Where you come from?” You said.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Oh sure,” I explained “I come
                from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll
                want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Oh,” you said, a little let down.
                “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have
                interacted with myself at some point.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Sure. Happens all the time. And
                with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s
                happening.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“So what’s the point of it all?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously?
                You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Well it’s a reasonable question,”
                you persisted.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>I looked you in the eye. “The
                meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“You mean mankind? You want us to
                mature?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“No, just you. I made this whole
                universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger
                and greater intellect.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Just me? What about everyone else?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“There is no one else,” I said.
                “In this universe, there’s just you and me.” </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You stared blankly at me. “But all
                the people on earth…”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“All you. Different incarnations
                of you.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Wait. I’m everyone</i>!?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Now you’re getting it,” I said,
                with a congratulatory slap on the back. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“I’m every human being who ever
                lived?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Or who will ever live, yes.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“And you’re John Wilkes Booth,
                too,” I added.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“And you’re the millions he
                killed.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“I’m Jesus?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“And you’re everyone who followed
                him.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You fell silent. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Every time you victimized
                someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve
                done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by
                any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You thought for a long time. </p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all
                this?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Because someday, you will become
                like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“Whoa,” you said, incredulous.
                “You mean I’m a god?”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus.
                You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time,
                you will have grown enough to be born.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“So the whole universe,” you said,
                “it’s just…”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s
                time for you to move on to your next life.”</p>
                
                <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And I sent you on your way. </p>
